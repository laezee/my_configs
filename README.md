# my config files

My config files for hyprland arch.

Repo contains:

1. btop - just config to view it the way I like.

2. nwg-bar

	- changed icons to sketch style
	- 5 options - shutdown reboot lock logout or do nothing
	- minimalist style - css file might be garbage as I have no willpower to fight with that
	- If you want to use it:
		- place it in correct directiories
		- change icons paths in bar.json

3. nwg-dock-hyprland
	- simple dock styled to fit with the rest of rice
	CHECK hyprland.conf AUTOSTART AND THIS !!!!!!!!!
